# Anga
Weather app. Because... why not ðŸ™‚

"Anga" is the Swahili word for atmosphere.

### Important!
- Please obtain an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and save it in `local.properties` with the format `OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key`
- **Please use a physical device when testing!** The `FusedLocationProviderClient` doesn't work great on emulators, the app might take long to obtain a location.
